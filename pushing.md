Stay low with torso leaning forward.
Arm doesn't move much. Push with the body weight transfer to get good power. Wrist is only for spin. 

Also don't have to slice under ball, can come down the back of the ball and through.  Play around with angles to put off opponent and change depth, penetration, speed and spin.
