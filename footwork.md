Balanced at all times on balls of feet (and toes).
Bounce and light so can react fast, grounded when playing the shot
Right foot moves back to create space for FH
Left foot moves back to make space for BH
You necessarily have to jump back with two feet

Half jump back after opening, long pushes and opponent going to open.

Right foot can go: forward, back, right
Left foot can go: forward, back, left 
Both feet can go: forward, back (up and down)
