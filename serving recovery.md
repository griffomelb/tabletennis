The left foot should turn towards diagonally towards the opponents backhand corner and be a little outside the left sideline to aid serve recovery position and weight transfer.

The right foot cannot the pivot around. The left foot has to snap back to outside the edge of the table with the right foot about 30cm left of the centre line favouring the FH.

From this position you can either stay where you are or jump a little to the left to hit a FH. 

When you jump back after the serve, you need to be arm+Bat length from the table. 

You need to land before or at the same time as the ball lands on the opponent's side of the table. You can make another little hop to re-centre your gravity, get lower and stay light (that is, two hops following serve). This will enabled you to move better to your next shot.
