see [[head position of forehand loop]]


Right shoulder much lower then the left at end of take away and through most of shot
Lag the right shoulder a bit to be more deceptive on ball direction
Elbow low
Some say the chest is over right leg however perhaps only  the top of the chest otherwise the right shoulder is not low.
Load the right leg with weight using the movement of the centre of gravity / head position over or behind the right foot
Make sure the toes of the right foot are pointing sideways somewhat parallel with the baseline of the table.
Give yourself plenty of room so the arm can fully extend at the start of the up / forward motion of the shot 
The weight should go on to the right foot (ball of the feet and toes) and push UP only. Maybe a little forward. 
The weight transfer happens with the hip and shoulder turn to the left foot.
You can make the right foot jump forward to exaggerate and make sure the weight transfer happens.
Left arm goes across the body to "catch the ball" at just in front of the contact point in the line of the incoming ball
