# Core
Your core is your stomach and back muscles. It is engage by standing upright a little and not bending at the waist too much.

You can sit back in your seat a little to assist engaging the core.

Core is used in the prepare stage of your shot


This is a potential solution that may help  have a relaxed upper body and an explosive lower body when playing table tennis.

Stand up and take a deep breathe in through your nose. Hold it for a few seconds. Then exhale fully through your nose. You should be able to feel your center of mass move up and then down. You should feel balanced after exhaling. You should feel solid around your core. And it should feel like a good position for moving quickly. Also, your arms and shoulders should feel relaxed and loose, able to play relaxed full motion shots.
