Keep you bat high and above the table after you shot. That is, do not hold your bat at table height or below the table in between shots.
The elbow should be a little wide of the body and a little forward.
The bat should be higher than the elbow.
The arm should be pointing at around 11 o'clock
The bat angle should be favouring the backhand
This allows you to block and play the next shot quicker.
