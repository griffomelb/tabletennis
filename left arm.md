You left arm (non bat holding arm) is used for many purposes.
It balance you
It helps with identification of the location of the ball contact
It helps with the shoulder and hip rotation on backswing of the forehand
It helps with follow through hip and shoulder rotation (when you pull your elbow back tight to your left hip)
It helps you not hit too early or late as you use your hand / wrist as 'positions in space' to compare to location of ball
It helps with the height above the ground the ball is contacted as again it is a 'point in space' that can be used for comparison.
