Relaxing in table tennis takes lots of things done properly.
Player on toes, bounce around a little, knees well bent, shoulders forwards, wrists limp (node forward), relaxed jaw, relaxed eyebrows / forehead, and a calm focussed mind (on opponents bat and ball flight).

Relax your jaw and shoulders to relax your mind. Shoulders forwards and limp wrist to relax your upper body and arms. Take a breath. 

Calm the mind but watch opponents bat and ball flight intently so that you can re-position your feet and body/balance to play the next shot.

See: [[pointing the node of the bat towards the ground]].

The hardest thing is to achieve both focussed and relaxed  _at the same time_.

An intense focus and relaxation can be described as in  "the zone" or "flow". 

Too relaxed mentally can impair focus, eg: not follow the path and timing of the ball bounce. Too focussed can tense muscles eg: watch ball and bounce path intently but raise shoulders or tense arm.  

Relax the wrist, which relaxes the arm. On toes and bounce and relax the body. Calm the mind but watch opponents bat and ball flight intently.  

Tight muscles are slow and accelerate poorly or not at all.
Not "unbelievably relaxed" as still need control, but not tight.
You can accelerate faster without tightening muscles.

Relaxed means that you can swing through freely but you still need to be able to maintain the technique which does require some muscle. If you are tense, you can’t get a full range of motion and can’t generate speed.

If you are too relaxed the strokes will become sloppy and inconsistent.

In most close situations in matches being too relaxed isn’t an issue, that is why we talk about focusing on being relaxed.

Forum quote: I try to get in the "flow", when I'm there I'm totally relaxed. How? When the ball is coming against me I quickly make a decision where I want to place the ball. Then I'm just letting my body do the stroke, without any thoughts like how to do the stroke, which angle, how hard, is it a too risky shot and so on. I'm just aiming for one point or a small area where i want place the ball. My body does everything it can (adjusting automatically) to fulfill what I want - to shoot the ball where I'm aiming. 

Website quote: A good test as to whether your arm is loose or tight is to imagine someone grabbing your arm as you stroke. They should have no problem in pulling your arm up or down. If you resist, then your arm muscles are too tight.

Website quote: **Look at any professional player, playing in a relaxed way with a relaxed technique, and you’ll see that their back is actually curved. Their shoulders are forwards, not backwards, and their spine is pushing out, not tucked in between their shoulder blades.**

So shoulders forwards. The best way to understand this is imagine you are a monkey or gorilla. Think about how they would stand (leaning forwards with a curved back) and what they would do with their arms (having their shoulders forwards and arms hanging/swinging underneath them). This might seem silly but this is pretty much the kind of position you want to be in. Get into that kind of gorilla position and then lift up your forearms so that the angle at your elbow is approximately 90 degrees, or slightly larger.
