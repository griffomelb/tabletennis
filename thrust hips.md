you can thrust hips forward in a connected way with your arm to get more power on your backhand.

If your hips go back, you chest will lean forward and you will create about 30cm more space for a backswing on the backhand. 

You can then thrust your hips forward (but don't lean back with shoulders).
Shoulder go up (if anything) and you stay balanced.
