Breathing is vital for [[relaxing]] and [[continuous hitting]]. I find saying a word or making a grunt after tightening the core releases the core muscles and helps you breath out and not hold your breath.

If you say "low" after contact of the ball, it both releases your breath and is a reminder to [[return to a low position]].
