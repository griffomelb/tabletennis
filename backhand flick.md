Wrist like Mick Owens. Outside of right side of body.

====**Need to lift node to create loop shape otherwise ball comes out== ==flat**==

==Contact at bottom of bat==


![[image006.png]]
Stay low and creep in like a panther with ==elbow high and wrist 75% rotated and node lifted a little.== 
==Then add the 25% extra backswing just before forward motion like towel flick.== 
==Wrist low almost on table==. 
Remember towel flick. 
Wrist starts low if not touching table.
Elbow high then snaps / drops as shot happens and ==comes backwards a little **with pivot point middle of fore arm==.** 
Bat needs to be hips side of elbow early to create leverage. 
Use left arm to position ball at point in space. ==Contact at wrist or later.== 
Slightly after top of bounce is possible but can wait later. 

==Contact is around the back of the ball more than you think== and bat location is like Mick Owen's, on right hip inside (to the right) of the ball. 

==You also do this takeaway and recoil movement with your hips.  This keeps the body moving, timing improved and recoil acceleration.==


==Keep lower back / hips loose==

==Head more upright (feels like head is tilted to the right==



### **Old technique** ... 
Keep your elbow low.
Node does not have to point backwards too much as movement can be small.
Feet closer together, knees bend and push up for lift.
Keep lower back / hips loose.
Shoulder rounded.
Right knee across a little. (knee movement)
Head more upright (feels like head is tilted to the right)
There is movement from steady to slightly bigger takeaway and recoil that gives a good bat head speed (like flicking a towel). You also do this takeaway and recoil movement with your hips.  This keeps the body moving, timing improved and recoil acceleration.
