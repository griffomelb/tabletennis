A = off the bounce, approximately 80%-120% the height of the net above the table.
B = just after top of bounce
C = on way down
D = on way down below table

A is if you are in position, balanced and can put a good lifting and controlling back down backhand shot on it. It can also be good timing on forehand but is higher risk as you can easily lift long and the shot relies on contact rather than controlling it back down like the backhand.
Between A and B is a block shot / active block shot.
B is the place to hit when you are in position and you are still close to the table
Between B and C you will likely loop long so try and avoid and wait for C position. 
C is the place to hit if you need to use your feet to get into position or want to hit a consistent standard loop. 
D is if you are way out of position or want to hit something unique, loopy and spinny but still fairly low on your opponents side.
