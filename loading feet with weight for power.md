Loading your feet properly on the toes and balls of your feet is critical for power transfer.

For the forehand, your weight goes to the right foot.
Your foot opens up and is parallel to the table pointing to the right.
Your left arm can come across to assist weight transfer and shoulder / hip rotation.
Shoulder rotation is MORE than the hips, to create the whip like affect of hips going through first and shoulders and then arm / bat coming next.
