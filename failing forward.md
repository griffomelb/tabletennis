"The difference between average people and achieving people is their perception of and response to failure."

His relationship with failure fascinated and inspired me.

What makes one person immune to the social pressure of failure, while thousands buckle under it's weight?

John C Maxwell discusses this in â€œFailing Forward". He demonstrates how success and failure are not separate experiences at opposite ends of the spectrum (like we learn at school), rather they're the same experience.

Because failure is what facilitates success.

It's the understanding and perception of failure that liberates and allows us to approach learning and attempt new things with the faultless enthusiasm of my Japanese classmate.

Who, by the way, improved at an astounding rate.

I like to think of failure as the fertiliser necessary for success. Without it there would be no growth, no opportunity, no burning desire for something more.

Failing Forward is a wonderful reminder that amazing experiences hide just beyond uncomfortable actions. And when you alter your attitude towards failure, failure alters towards you.
