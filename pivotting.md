Right foot replaces left or even wider so make sure left foot is wide enough
Best to be 30cm away from table and wider than the table by about 50cm
Get sideways to left sideline with body and 11 o'clock with left foot
Either position **B** for power or **D** (for high spin loop) in timing.
On follow through, **hip turn first**, weight transfer to left foot and left **foot opens**.
Push back with the left foot to recover your position and balance.
**Open body to hit next forehand** before doing any cross step shot.
