Should be banned. Soin (top and back) can work against their tactics, but they can slap through if good enough. 

Push low to short pips as they can't create loop. 
Serve low to the pips.  Short and low.  No spin would mess with them.  

Powerful spiiby shots to the pips troubles them.  They need PERFECT timing so take the time away from them. 

Slow spinny can work, but also can work against you if they hit through and have time to play their shot. 

See Ping skills summary here, later part if video is excellent.
