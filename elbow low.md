# Elbow low
It is vital to keep the elbow low throughout:
1. [[Over the table shots]]
2. [[forehand]]
3. [[backhand]]

The elbow at the start of forehand and backhand should be approximately table height. 

Unconfirmed: It has been said to keep the elbow on the same horizontal plane in comparison to your body, say the height of your hips.
