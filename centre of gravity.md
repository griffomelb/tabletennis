Your centre of gravity revolves around your coccyx and is influenced by the bend of your knees and the position of your head.

You can lower your centre of gravity by bending your knees.
You can shift your centre of gravity backwards and forwards using the position of your head and sternum. The more you position your head / sternum back, the weight goes back and vice versa.
