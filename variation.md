Variation of serve and shot is very important
variation makes your opponent not get comfortable and always either guess or look longer at the ball / bat than they need to to ascertain what they should do.
If you always serve short, they always can flick
Always long, always attacks.
Always same loop style, easily block and counter.
Serve location on table.
Serve to forehand and backhand
Serve topspin, no spin, sidespin and topspin and combinations.
Slow spiniery loops
Faster flatter loops
Forehand down the line, to the middle, to forehand and wide forehand.
Backhand to the middle, to wide backhand etc.
