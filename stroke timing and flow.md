You can finish the shot at the top of the shot, both [[forehand]] and [[backhand]]. 
Then, as the opponent hits the ball, you track the ball and 'accept it in' to the hitting space with the recovery phase backstroke, adjust your feet positioning and [[balancing double bounce]]  at the same time, [[ground the weight]], then push up and play your stroke. 

On the forehand you push up and forward. 

My forehand should be more compact and tighter. Smaller on the starting position and compact on the finishing.
