# Backhand 

The backhand off backspin ... bat between legs and node down.  Accelerate to left before ball. 

Follow up make sure elbow is out and node has rotated back.  Let ball in and hit.  Can get at top off bounce. 




A backhand is often played in front and you do not wait as long as you do on the forehand shot.

Elbow should stay relative stable to ensure consistency. 

## Summary:
For the opening shot, I like to keep my elbow low and [[the node]] of the bat pointing more upwards to between ten and 11 o'clock. It is also important to begin to [[cock your wrist]] back a little.  You can also use a jabbing like  punch like movement to move the [[elbow forwards]] to get more forwards motion as well as rotation. 

For follow up backhands I like to put my elbow forward a little more and play a kind of [[hitting through]] and  [[over the top]] shots.

#### Backhand off backspin
For backhand off backspin you must 

The first movement is a slight wrist bend inwards (not cock) and accelerate to the left a bit the finish right. 

Use your hips !!! THRUST. TO GET THROUGH THE BALL. 

1. Stand fairly square to the oncoming ball (don't open left shoulder or right foot much if at all)
2. Left arm out to position contact point, distance from body and balance
3. Get your elbow to table height. 
4. Drop the bat even lower. 
5. Lower your [[centre of gravity]].
6. Tense you [[core]] and connect it to your arm
7. Right [[knee across]]
8. Right shoulder curl across 
9.  Cock your wrist. See [[cock wrist on backhand]]
10. Focus on the [[point of contact]] and contact part of bat (see below)
11. The elbow position and  the point of contact for a backhand should "make sense" for the shot. For backhand off backspin I believe the angle of the arm should be about **10 o'clock**  with the [[node]] already pointing to **11 o'clock**. 
12. Can thrust your hips forward in connection with the shot for more power. However, don't lean back after shot. Shoulders should be square to direction of shot and balanced. 

Contact point on bat is around the outside of the edge of the bat (highlighted green below)

#### Backhand off topspin
For backhand off topspin there are essentially two useful timings.
Off the table at 80% of net height above table (point A), or on way down after peak and between 80% higher than the net and a net height below the table (point B). Point C and Point D are ok as well. 
In between point A and point B becomes a block at the top of the bounce.
