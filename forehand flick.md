Chest over the middle of the table early
Point the [[node]] of the bat to the right and open your wrist.
The bat needs to stay low and come upwards.
The face of the bat is typically flat, that is, neither open nor closed.
Contact is ideally at the top of the bounce.
It helps to get into position early(chest over table and bat open and back) and pause. 
You can also do the loopy action before, which goes from high to low to high for a whippier action.

The flick needs a relaxed arm, fingers and hand.
