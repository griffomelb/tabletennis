The timing is very early off the bounce, about 4/5ths the height of the net from the table.
The angle of your bat is important (how open or closed)
You must cover the ball
However, you **must lift** in the first part and then control the finish with the arm

Your [[left arm]] should be out to balance you and assist timing.
